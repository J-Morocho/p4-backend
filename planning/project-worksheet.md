## Time/Priority Matrix 


#### MVP 

- Registration is required in order to utilize this API
- Once logged in the user is presented with a dashboard that has a sidebar containing the categories they've registered as well
as a list of plants within those categories
- In order to begin tracking plants the user will need to create a category and add the desired plant to it
- Registration of categories begins in the sidebar, a modal will open up that allows the user to create a new category if they wish
- Once a category is created the main page will display a button allowing a user to add a plant
- Plants have a name, description, as well as a required category that can be defined
- Once a plant is created its information is displayed on the page along with tracking details

#### PostMVP 

- Functionality that allows tracking of ambient temperature and amount of light recieved
- Search for plants where needs have not been met
